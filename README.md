# HubSpot Candidate Coding Exercise - Countries

I'm not a fan of timed coding exercises, especially if they are used to screen job candidates before actually speaking to a hiring manager. I'm sure there are developers without testing anxiety or physical disabilities who can code and test this exercise well within 3 hours.

I found this candidate coding exercise on a public github repo. I don't think the posted solution would have worked, but this one passes. I coded using NodeJS and Typescript fresh from the PDF coding exercise document.

If there are other HubSpot Candidate Coding Exercises out there (with an API key), I'd like to tackle them and post my solution.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
