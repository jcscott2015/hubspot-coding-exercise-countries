# HubSpot Candidate Coding Exercise - Countries

I'm not a fan of timed coding exercises, especially if they are used to screen job candidates before actually speaking to a hiring manager. I'm sure there are developers without testing anxiety or physical disabilities who can code and test this exercise well within 3 hours.

I found this candidate coding exercise on a public github repo. I don't think that solution would have worked, but this one passes. I coded using NodeJS and Typescript from the PDF coding exercise document, and only glanced at the posted solution.

## Install Node Modules

### `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in production mode, from the `dist` folder.\

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the developer mode.\
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
